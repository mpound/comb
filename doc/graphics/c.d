Appendix C - a sample format under stress

The following few pages show the format defined as an example in "Formats"
as it appears in the whole screen, in a 1x3 array of boxes, and in a
2x4 array of boxes on a device whose screen is physically square.
Notice that in the 2x4 array, place 1 goes outside the box.
This must happen at some number of boxes with any format.
