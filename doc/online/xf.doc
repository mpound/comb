xf - Transfer stacks to dir 2 after making them unique (1 per position)


EXAMPLES:

ns "..."		Make sure that the foreground dir is source of stacks
ns "...new" dt:		Background dir is to receive the stacks
xf v:3			Transfer all of the stacks from the foreground dir to
			the background dir after combining all at the same
			position, freq, and filter wid. give a running
			description.
xf 40_120 fwid:.1 ptol:.5 v:1	Transfer stacks 40 through 120 to dt after
			combining with any matching stacks from the rest of
			the file.  Combine stacks whose angular separation
			is no greater than 0.5' Arc.  Transfer only stacks with
			a filter width of 100KHz.  Give only a summary report.
xf 40_120 sn:10,200 mxwt:350	Transfer stacks 40 to 120 to dt, but limit
			the range of search for matching files to stacks 10 to
			200.  If the any weight of a combined stack is > 350
			reduce it to 350 so that one point will not be too
			heavily weighted in a map.

DESCRIPTION:

Xf is designed to help make a cleaned up directory of stacks from one
which has had data thrown at it.  It uses the foreground directory as a
source of data and stores its output in directory two.  It will combine
all matching stacks into a single one before transferring to dt.  It compares
the scan number lists of two similar stacks before combining them and doesn't
do the co if there are scans in common (it also doesn't transfer the second
stack to dt).  The source stacks can be limited by stack number, center freq,
and filter width.  The stacks to be combined with them can be limited by
stack number and position tolerance.

Xf has a maximum weight option for help in limiting the influence of any
position which may have been observed much more than its neighbors.

The v: option allows you to control how verbose xf will be.  A value of 0
gives no report and 3 a rather complete report of xf's deliberations.
Intermediate values give intermediate results.
