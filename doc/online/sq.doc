sq - increase or decrease the effective channel width in stack 1.	RWW
 

EXAMPLES:
sq 0.5			Double the number of channels in the spectrum in stack 
			1. If the center channel is at a channel boundary ie.
			128.5, each old channel will be duplicated in the
			new spectrum.
sq .freq1/.freq2	Squish stack 1 so that it will have the same channel
			width in velocity as stack 2 and they can be processed
			compatibly.

DESCRIPTION:
Squish is used to change the channel width of a spectrum so that the spectra
from two different molecules will have the same channel width in velocity.
The can then be processed together by divide or ca.

Squish treats the data as though the filters were square topped and of their
nominal width. Squish lays out a new set of filters on top of the old, aligned
at the 'center of squish'. Each new channel is filled by a weighted sum from
the old channels. Partial channels from the old spectrum are considered to have
the temperature of the old channel and the partial fraction of the weight.
A new channel may be made up of a combination of partial and full channels
from the old spectrum. If the resulting spectrum has fewer than 512 channels it
is left justified. Otherwise the 'center of squish' is put as close to the
center of the new spectrum as possible without loosing any more channels than
necessary.

The 'center of squish' will default to the 'center channel' of the old spectrum.
