c - Calculate a value					RWW


EXAMPLES:

c #2=log(3|27)			set global variable 2 = log base 3 of 27
c $=$3				set string variable 0 = string variable 3
c #1=2				assign the value 2 to global numeric
				variable 1.
c $5="hello"			assign the value "hello" to string variable 5
rt 10;c .label="Orion A";st 10	assign the value "Orion A" to the header variable
				.label in stack 10.
c #=#+1				increment global numeric variable 0
c .rms1=.25			change the value of rms in the stack 1
				header to 0.25
c .stak1(68)= 10		set channel 68 of stack1 to 10 for a test.

DESCRIPTION:

C is used to evaluate an expression without printing the result.  The normal
use of c is for the side effect of assigning a new value to a global or header
variable during evaluation.

Note: INTEGER data types are just special cases of REALs.
