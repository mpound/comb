                            Command Syntax
                           ----------------

A comb command consists of 2 basic parts: a command name followed by a
delimited list of arguments. The delimiters may be commas or spaces (it's okay
to mix the two).  The command name is a one- or two-character mnemonic for the
function, e.g. "cm" is contour map. The arguments can take a variety of
forms: numerical, character string, numerical range, list, flag, toggle, and
expression.  The command "lk" (look), which displays the location of
spectra on the sky, is a good example of most of these types.

Command arguments are arranged in a syntax tree, with a unique label to specify
each node of the tree.  This syntax tree is what is printed out when you 
type " ??" after a command name.  For instance,

-> lk ??

Look at where stacks are "lk"
  Horizontal limits "xl"
    Left x "lx" - REAL, OLD(0)
    Right x "rx" - REAL, OLD(0)
  Vertical limits "yl"
    Bottom y "by" - REAL, OLD(0)
    Top y "ty" - REAL, OLD(0)
  Stack number limits "sn"
    Low "l" - INTEGER, OLD(10)
    High "h" - INTEGER, OLD(262143)
  Plot Symbol "ps"
    Figure Number "fign" - INTEGER, SET(4)
    Figure height "fh" - REAL, AUTOMATIC(0)
    Figure width "fw" - REAL, AUTOMATIC(0)
    Filled "fill" - FLAG(no)
  Center Frequency (MHz) "fr" - REAL RANGE, OLD(0_990000)
  Plot stack numbers "psn" - FLAG(no)
  Horizontal label "hlb" - STRING, AUTOMATIC
  Vertical label "vlb" - STRING, AUTOMATIC
  Main label "mlb" - STRING, AUTOMATIC
  Line type "lt" - INTEGER, OLD(255)
  Check search vs stack "chk" - FLAG(no)
  Directory two "dt" - FLAG(no)
  Overlay "ovl" - FLAG(no)

Labels, e.g. "xl:", "fr:", "mlb:", are delineated by a colon. If the arguments
are entered in the order in which they appear in the syntax tree, then the
labels are not needed. Use of labels, however, allows arguments to be entered
in any order or arguments to be skipped altogether, if desired, and is also
handy for remembering arguments in the list. Arguments following labels may
take optional square brackets, e.g. "lk fr:[110200_110300]". Square brackets
are required when the arguments type is a list, e.g. "cp sc:[0,20,2,39,3,49]".

Nitty-gritty details of syntax trees, the meanings of AUTOMATIC, SET, OLD, etc.
and the parser are available in the Help topic 'parser'.
