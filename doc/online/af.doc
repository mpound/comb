af -  Attach (read in) a FITS file to an image 

EXAMPLES:

af "fits.out";cp	The file fits.out in the current directory is
			opened, associated with image 1, and a contour
			plot of it is made.

af "oria.13co" im:3	The file oria.13co is opened as image 3.

af "myspectrum" st:     Read in the FITS spectrum myspectrum from 
			disk into stack 1.

c #=10;do 100 {af "/dev/rmt12" st:1;st #;c #=#+1}   
			Read in 100 FITS spectra from tape and store them 
			in the the first 100 stack locations.

DESCRIPTION:

A FITS file is the same as a FITS tape, except that it is on disk and
doesn't have 2880 byte records.  A file on a FITS tape may be read onto
disk with $COMB/bin/rfitstape and a FITS file may be written to tape with
$COMB/bin/wfitstape.  Or, more simply, specify /dev/rmtN as the filename.

af opens the given FITS file and reads its header into a new data
structure associated with the designated image.  If the header is not
acceptable, an error message might be given and the image closed.  For
the present unrecognized header lines are printed on your screen and
ignored. Spectra can only be read into memory, i.e., stacks 1, 2, or 3.

NOTE: 

When reading in CLASS FITS spectra written by the FCRAO program SPA (and 
possibly some other programs), the LSR Velocity of the spectrum (.vlsr) will 
be the velocity of channel 1. This is because SPA sets the FITS keywords 
CRPIX1=1 and VELO equal to the velocity of that channel.  The velocity 
axis of the spectrum will still be correct; but the displayed LSR velocity 
will not match that of the source.  To fix this, use "cc" to change .vlsr 
and .expch (=CRPIX1) to the source values (usually the center channel), e.g., 

-> af "SPA.FITS.spectrum" st:1

-> p .numpt		   ! print number of channels
128

-> p .expch                ! print channel of CRPIX1 
1

-> vlct,.expch 		   ! print velocity of CRPIX1
-10.429101

-> cc vl:9.0 		   ! change VLSR to source velocity (km/s)

-> p .expch
64.5

-> vlct,.expch
9

-> p .vlsr		   ! Voila!
9
