fo - fold freq switched data


EXAMPLES:
fo		fold the data in stack 1.

DESCRIPTION:
Fold does a weighted average of the channels around the 'signal' channel
with the negative of those around the 'reference' channel in stack 1. Only
channels with overlap are retained in the final spectrum.

Fold sets the '4' bit in the header variable 'nprc'. It will refuse to fold
data which was not frequency switched or has been previously folded.
