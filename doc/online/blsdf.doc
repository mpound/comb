			SPECTRAL SCAN DESCRIPTION

There are two types of spectral scan formats which originated at Bell Labs. 
The first, now known as the "old Bell Labs" (or simply "old") format, 
was replaced at the end of 1991 by the "Bell Labs Spectral Data File" (BLSDF)
or "scan2" format.  Scan2 is more flexible than the old format because it 
allows variable length data records, a variable number of spectra per record, 
and arbitrary keywords in addition to "standard ones".  In the old format, 
scan header variables were accessed by their location in the array .ndat() 
(e.g., "p .ndat(1)" would print the scan number). In scan2 format, the
header variables are accessed by name (e.g., "p .ScanNum").

If you want to know what header variables are present in your scans, you can 
type "pd sc:" to display the variable names and values.  The value of any 
variable can be accessed by putting a "." in front of the name. For instance,
".ScanNum" is the value of the variable ScanNum.  Which header variables are 
present depends on where your data originated.  (i.e., Bell Labs, DSN, 
AST/RO, NRAO).  For a list of common scan2 keywords, type "keyw".

Comb also understands the NRAO scan formats known as PDFL and SDD (Singledish 
Data). However, to the user these formats appear identical to scan2, although 
the keyword names and/or meanings may differ.  Where possible, we have 
converted the names used by NRAO to those used by Bell Labs. PDFL is no 
longer supported by NRAO, having been replaced by SDD in 1993. The PDFL format 
went through a number of backwards incompatible changes before being replaced 
by SDD; comb will recognize only the final version used by NRAO in 1992-1993. 
For a list of common NRAO keywords, type "nrao". 

This rest of this document details the scan2 format and gives a description of 
the .ndat() array contents.  


		The Bell Laboratories Spectral Data File

This file type allows variable length data records (scans) with the
possibility of a variable number of spectra per record.  Scan numbers
will be sequential and it is expected that scans will be accessed by
number.  In the interest of rapid access for data reduction and economy
of space, numbers in the header and data are currently required to be in
binary, i.e. two's complement integers or IEEE floating point values.
There are also two somewhat arbitrary limits imposed on the data:  
1) The byte order in the file will be Big Endian (IBM, Motorola, Sun).  
2) Binary numbers (int, double, etc.) will be located at even locations
modulo their length.  It would be relatively easy to make a reader
which removed all three of these restrictions.

The file begins with a preamble which has an ASCII description of the
data in the file through a set of keywords giving their location, type,
and number of array elements (usually 1).  Immediately following this
is a main header which applies to the whole file.  Following this are
the scans.  Scans will have header variables and may have either one
data vector or one or more 'arrays', each with optional header values
and a data vector.  Except for a few housekeeping header values, the
reading program will be able to accept header values in any of the
three locations as given by the preamble.

The preamble contains a description of the file based on keywords which
are given one per line.  There are three white-space-separated fields
in each line with an optional comment following the last:

Keyword  Which_Hdr  Format  /Comments

An example line is:
HMIFreq  M 1E		/ 864 Lock loop Harmonic mixer intermediate frequency

Keyword:  The keyword should have 8 or fewer printable chars.  I suggest
using upper case at the beginning of each concatenated word.

Which_Hdr:  There are three places for header values:

M: The main header.  These values will be constant for the whole file.
S: The Scan header.  Most header values will be here in two's complement
   integer, IEEE floating point, or fixed length string format.
A: The Array header.  Scans may contain more than one spectrum when the
   telescope has more than one spectrometer, an array of receivers,
   etc.  The header values which change from spectrum to spectrum will
   immediately precede the corresponding array of data.  The offset
   is from the given start of the array (bytes).

Format:  The formats descriptions are taken from FITS 3-D Binary tables
format and were adopted from FORTRAN format specifications.  They have
the form 'rX' where 'r' is a repeat count (array length) and X gives
the data type.  The Formats are:

rC: 8 Bit signed two's complement integers.

rI: 16 Bit signed two's complement integers.

rJ: 32 Bit signed two's complement integers.

rE: 32 Bit IEEE format floating point numbers.

rA: A character string of length r (8 Bit chars.).

Comment:  By convention, this field should start with a '/', although
the reader now ignores any remainder of the line.  A line which begins
with a '/' is treated as a comment by the reader, but the software which
sets up the reader in Comb treats such lines as valid header variables,
so that that keyword could be recognized.

As the main header is read,  each item is assigned the next location in
its header.  The order in the binary headers is determined from the
order in the preamble.  Each value will be located on an 'even'
boundary for its size.  Thus doubles are on even 8 byte addresses but
chars can be anywhere.  There may be holes in a header, just as in a
struct in C.

The preamble will be followed on the next 8 byte boundary by the Main
header, followed by the scans (also on 8 byte boundaries).
At the end of a scan, the arrays will probably be located on an
8 byte boundary, but a writer is free to locate them in any way
as long as each element of each array is on the appropriate boundary.

A few keywords will be needed for managing the format of the file.
Many others will be needed to describe the spectral line data.  The
first keyword should be:

SIMPLE M 5A 'blsdf' /This should convince any FITS reader to stop.

If an index area is to be used with variable length scans, the
following should be in the Main header:

MaxScans M 1J n /This sets the size of the index (which need not be full).
RecLoc I 1J  /This is the variable in the index which gives the scan location.

If no index is given we need:

ScanSize M 1J n /The size of each scan in bytes (a multiple of 8)

In a scan the first header value should be:

ScanNum S 1J /The scan number as known by the observer

The last header value in a scan gives the locations of the data arrays.
The number of arrays must have been given earlier.  These could be in
any appropriate integer format.  A repeat of 0 for ArrayLoc indicates
that its length is determined in the scan header, not the main header.

NumArray S 1C
....
ArrayLoc S 0J /The array offsets start in this location.

These could be in the Main header if they never change:

NumArray M 1C 3
....
ArrayLoc M 3J n1 n2 n3

Another required value is the number of channels in each array.  Normally
this would be in the array header, but it could be in the scan or main 
header if it applies to all arrays in the scan or all arrays in the file.

    6-10   The low-order part of the filter widths (Hz),
            i.e., the filter width for the ith filter bank
            equals:  10**4 x NDAT(43+i) + NDAT(5+i)

    12     The high-order part of the Doppler velocity
            (km/sec x 10)
            This is the velocity of the antenna with
            reference to the LSR projected on the source
            direction.  This velocity adds algebraically to
            NDAT(4) to give  the total velocity.  See NDAT

    17     The low-order part of the lock loop if frequency during the
           reference phase of frequency switching.  See NDAT(64).
           In Hz, the reference if is: 10**5 x NDAT(64) + NDAT(17)*10

    18     Integration time (seconds x 10)
              Equals total scan time for position switching
              or frequency switching but equals (total

            backend number 1 for which TS = NDAT(66).

    23     SIN(ELEV) x 2**14   (As at Kitt Peak)

    24     The low-order part of the lock loop IF frequency during the
           signal part of the frequency switch cycle.
           The lock loop signal IF frequency = NDAT(63) x 10**5 +

    26     Signal sideband spillover factor:  % of beam
            directed skywards.

    27     Beam efficiency:  % of total beam directed at the
            sky which also falls within a one-half degree
            disc.

          NOTE:  This is different from Kitt Peak where the same
          table would be assigned the numbers 1,3,0 and 2.

    44-48  High-order parts of filter widths (See description of
          NDAT(6-10)

    49     Number subtracted from the data  (As at Kitt Peak)

    50-54  The number of channels in each filter bank for filter
          banks 1-5

    55-60  These values do not include the offsets in NDAT(61-
          62)

    55     Hours of right ascention

    57     Seconds of right ascention

    58     Degrees of declination

    59     Minutes of declination

    60     Seconds of declination

    61     Right ascention offset (Minutes of Arc x 10)  This is
          a coordinate angle, not a true arc length.  In OBS,
          RAMAP is a true arc length; thus, NDAT(61) =
          RAMAP/COS(DEC). See NDAT(107).

    62     Declination offset (Minutes of Arc x 10) See NDAT(108)

    63     Signal (MHz x 10).  This is the lock loop IF
          frequency.  If frequency switching, it is the value
          during the signal interval.

    64     Reference (MHz x 10)
          This equals 0 if not frequency switching.  At Texas
          and Kitt Peak, this is the IF frequency of the lock
          loop during the reference interval of a frequency
          switch.  At Crawford Hill, the synthesizer frequency
          is shifted for frequency switching instead of the IF
          frequency.  Since there is only one place for
          synthesizer frequencies, (NDAT(37-39)), a fake
          frequency is put here so COMB will get the correct
          reference frequency.

    65     Calibration temperature (TC) (As at Kitt Peak)  (10 x
          Kelvin).
          This was the user-supplied number chosen at the time
          of the observation as the strength of the calibration
          signal.

    70*    Receiver gain (Volts x 1000)  (As at Kitt Peak,
          NDAT(51))

    71*    Size of the sample box (Arc Sec x 10)
          (As at Kitt Peak, NDAT(63))

    72*    Mapping Angle (degrees x 10)

    73     The right ascention offset of the reference position
          (for position switching) from the center of the source

A scan file starts off with a scan length superheader.  Only the first
28 bytes of this "scan" contain any information and only the first few
shorts are useful.

struct SH {
        short nszsc     Number of sectors (256 bytes) per scan
        short nfsc      Scan number of first scan in file minus one
