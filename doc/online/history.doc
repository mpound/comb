                        The History Mechanisms
                      --------------------------

Comb has a history mechanism to recall, edit, and execute 
previously-issued commands, much like the history in various 
UNIX shells. Comb's history is based in the Korn Shell (ksh).
It is essentially a one-line version of the screen-editor program, 
defined by your environment variable EDITOR (vi or emacs).
You do not have to be running  ksh as your normal UNIX shell
to make use of the comb history mechanism. Commands you type at
the -> prompt are stored  in $HOME/.combhistory. 

The history is entered by the escape key (ESC) for vi mode, or the 
control key (CNTL) for emacs mode. The sequence ESC-k [CNTL-P] will 
scroll back through the stored command commands lines which you can 
then edit using normal vi [emacs] commands. The sequence ESC-j [CNTL-N] 
scrolls forward. Searching is accomplished by ESK-/ [<whatever it is
in emacs>].

In addition to the ksh-like history mechanism, comb also has a 
``command archive'' mechanism (left over from the days before ksh),
allowing archiving, re-execution, or editting of the immediately 
previous command line. It is completely distinct from the ksh-like 
history.  Comb keeps the previous command line and allows the user to 
access it with the following commands:

      . or .e    Execute the previous (old) command as it is.
      .p         Print the old command.
      .an        Store the old command in archive n, n = 0 through 9
      .n         Retrieve the command in archive n.
      .s/xxx/yy  Edit the old command substituting the string yy
                 for the first occurence of xxx. The delimiter may be
                 any character, not just `/' (similar to sed).
