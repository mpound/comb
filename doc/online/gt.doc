gt - get a scan or series of scans			RWW & MWP

EXAMPLES:
gt 80a108,nbe:		Get the narrow backend of the given scan.
gt 80a108_112,dt:	Sequentially plot the data (not cal and sky) scans
			in the range 108 to 112.
p #1=1 dp:;do w:".test" {gt dt: ts:;li,1;st a:}	go forward getting only
			data scans and storing them till the center position
			or velocity changes.
gt st:-1,ca:		Get the previous cal.
gt ,,-1,ca:		Get the previous cal.

gt ss:2			Get the subscan 2 (a la NRAO 12m. Kitt Peak
			users--see below!) This flag is ignored
			for Bell Labs format scans. The be: flag is
			ignored for SDD (Kitt Peak) scans.

gt fss:			Get the first scan in stack 1.

gt first:		Get the first scan in the file (which may not be scan
			number 1). For NRAO scans, this will also
			set scan header variables .FrstScan and 
			.LastScan (see "pd main:")

gt last:		Get the last scan in the file.  For NRAO scans, 
			this will also set scan header variables 
			.FrstScan and .LastScan (see "pd main:")

gt type:"LS"		Get the next scan of type "LS".  This only works
			with scan2 headers containing the ObsType header
			variable and is mostly for AST/RO.  It requires
			a match of the characters in ObsType.

gt 100_150 dt: t:	Gets scans in the range 100 to 150 which are recognized
	or		as data.  If successful, .test is set to 1, otherwise
gt 100_150 type:"BC" t: .test is set ot 0.  An error message may be given
			if the first matching scan doesn't have a matching
			backend.

DESCRIPTION:

Gt converts scan data into stack data. It is used either as a way of viewing
data or in preparation for further processing or storing of the data as a
stack. If a range of scan numbers is given (with a possible step size) the
scans are sequentially put in stack 1 and plotted. File boundaries may be
passed either forward or backward if step size is set to the correct sign.
After each plot but the last, gt waits for a 'return' before making the next
plot. The process can be interrupted by typing '^C' in the usual way. A single
scan or the last scan is not plotted directly, but at the end of the command
line an auto plot will be made if it is enabled. If you cause another plot to
be made before the end of the command line (eg. with 'pl') the plot flag will be
cleared.

The backend can be specified either by number or name. The backend starts out
set to 1 and remembers its current type until changed.

If a limit on type is given (dt. ,ps. ,ca. ,etc.) only scans of the specified
type will be shown.  Alternately for users of scan2 files, a type may be
specified with the type:"XXX" option where "XXX" must match the characters in
.ObsType in the header of the scan.

If the 'ts:' flag is given, the first gt on a command line will save the center
position and frequency.  Subsequent gets in the same command line will compare
the new position and freq to the saved values.  'Header' variable
.test will be set to 1 on the first call and later ones if there is
no change.  If there is a change, it will be set to 0.

The t: option eliminates most error messages if the requested type of scan is
not found and instead sets .test to 1 on success and 0 on failure.  The one
exception is if the current type of backend is not found, an error will still
be called.  Without the t: option, an error message will be given if the
requested scan is not found.  In either case on failure, the current scan
number and file are set back to the previous value.

If no scan number is given the previous scan will be put in stack 1 again
unless a limit on type is given. In this case step will be repeatedly added to
the scan number until a scan of the requested type is found. This could take a
long time if no such scan is nearby. As usual you can stop whatever comb is
doing by typing '^C'.  File boundaries will be passed if there is an adjacent
file name.

'Scan number' has a special meaning in comb. It consists of the last three
characters of the file name (the last of which must be alphabetic) followed by
the number. Thus '80a11326' refers to scan 11326 in a file whose name ends in
80a. (The full file name will be '/cdata/c80a' unless you have used 'nf' to
change it.) The 'scan number' can be abbreviated by leaving off as many of the
left hand characters of the file name as have not changed.  After the previous
'scan number' if you type gt 81 you will see 80a81.  All of the commands of
comb which use 'scan numbers' share the same current scan number. (For details
of scan numbers and filename conventions in NRAO SDD format, see below).

If the environment variable SCANFILE is set to the full path name of a scan
file in the directory which holds your favorite scan files, then comb will
be initialized to get scan 1 of that file.  This will make it easy to access
other scan files whose full path name differs only in the last three
characters using 'scan numbers'.  If SCANFILE was not set when comb was
started, you may use nf to set the full path name of a scan file and then
continue using only the 'scan number' as described above.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR NRAO 12m USERS:				

Users on the NRAO 12m at Kitt Peak can now use comb directly on their raw "SDD"
data files.  SDD (SingleDish Data) format is now the NRAO standard and replaces
PDFL. PDFL is no longer supported by NRAO (as of ~10/93). However, comb still
understands PDFL format data files.  One uses 'nf' to name the data file then
gt as described above, e.g.,

-> nf "/home/data/data/sdd.you_001"            

-> gt 10

Hybrid Spectrometer data are written to a separate file:

-> nf "/home/data/data/sdd_hc.you_001"            

The SDD format refers to all data taken simultaneously with the same scan
number using subscan numbers to identify different backends, etc. The subscan
numbering convention is as follows:

         Parallel Filterbanks
subscan

  01  First half First polarization
  02  Second half First polarization

  03  First half Second Polarization
  04  Second half Second Polarization
  
         Series Filterbanks

  01  First polarization
  03  Second Polarization

         Hybrid Correlator

  11  First polarization
  12  Second Polarization
  1x  x is 1 through 4 in four IF mode
  1x  x is 1 through 8 for the 8-beam

To retrieve a particular subscan, use the ss: flag,

-> gt 100 ss:1		Get the data from subscan 1 of scan 100

-> gt ss:3		Get subscan 3 of the current scan 

All subscans share the SAME scan number which may complicate use of 'xf'
later.

Note that the scan list shown in a spectrum plot lists the last three
characters of the file name (typically "001" for SDD files) as an identifier.
By renaming your file, you can make this more useful. For instance, if the data
were taken in February 1993, you might rename the file "sdd_you.f93". The scan
list would then say, e.g "f93 20 21 22 23" instead of "001 20 21 22 23". This
renaming cannot occur while you are observing, since the NRAO 12m control
software wants a file named with "001".

File boundary names are NOT crossed for SDD data files. Once you get to the end
of the file, you must use 'nf' again to name the next file.

Comb will not deal with 'focalize' or pointing data, so use LINE or CONDAR to
reduce these. Basically, no guarantees are made for most continuum data.
