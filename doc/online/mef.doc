	Description of the Parse Tree that 'Me' Uses in Reading Maps Files

Each logical line in a maps file (except the last one) should completely
describe a map.  Thus each line should name the directory containing the map,
give its range of coordinates, specify the backend, etc.  (Note that
both FS and PS may be given if either type of data is ok, but rmacro
may be hard to write in that case).

The last line  of the file must contain only the 'lsn:' option so that
'me' will update the correct thing.

At this writing (2/11/87)  the survey (smaps and its macros in
/ua/comb/bin/.GMACROS) uses the largest number of features of 'me' and
nmaps contains the largest number of maps.  You should look at one of
them (in /ua/comb/lib) for examples of the maps files entries and in
the corresponding stacks macro files for examples of 'smacro', etc.  In
the case of smaps, the macros are in the global macro file.

It is useful while debugging the description of a new map to change
'rmacro' to print instead of storing.
