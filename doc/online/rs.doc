rs - Rescale and add a constant to the data in stack 1.		RWW
 
EXAMPLES:

rs 2,-1		Multiply the data in stack 1 by 2 and subtract 1
rs,1.1		Multiply the data in stack 1 by 1.1. 

DESCRIPTION:

Rescale multiplies the data in stack 1 by fact and then adds add to it.
Rescale also multiplies the header value "factt" in stack 1 by the same
factor.  So you can always "unscale" the data with "rs 1/.factt" (assuming 
add: has always been 0).
