These are "peculiarities" known to be in comb 1996.0 and previous
versions.  

1) "The negative RA problem"

This shows up if you make 'cm' or 'lk' maps in absolute coordinates
(i.e. with map center (RA,DEC) = (0H, 0D) and offset type in hours)  
with RA extending past RA=12h. For instance, suppose you have
stacks located between 15h and 16h and between 45d and 50d. The
commands:

-> rc rd:0,0 r:
Current relative coordinate system:
    SYSTEM NAME     |        CENTER COORDINATES        |     OFFSET TYPE
MyStacks            | rd(1950.0)  0:00:00.0,   0:00:00 |  dra(h) ddec(d)

-> lk,16:00,15:00,45,50

will not display your stack locations properly.  In most cases, it
will not display your stack locations at all.  However, the command 

-> lk,-8,-9,45,50  

will display them correctly but with negative RA labels along the
bottom axis (i.e., -8:00 to -9:00).    

2) "The CDELTn problem"

This problem is related to the fact that CDELTn is not a
well-defined quantity in FITS for longitude-like coordinates, i.e.
if it is a true angular spacing or a coordinate spacing.  RA-DEC
FITS files written from comb adhere to the FITS standard, but 
files in galactic coordinates may not. Comb currently produces 
FITS files in the same way that IPAC routines do.
