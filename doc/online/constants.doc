 Comb 1999 and later has predefined physical constants
 for your convenience.  They are accessed by the 
 usual "dot" mechanism (see help on "variables" if you don't
 know what that is). For instance, pi is .PI:

 -> p .PI
 3.14159 

 The values of the  physical constants come from NIST, so
 they are defined with as much precision as is known. 
 The transcendental numbers are defined out to 16 decimal places.
 To print them all, type 'cnst'.  See also dv ?! for the exact 
 definitions.
