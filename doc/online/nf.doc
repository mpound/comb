nf - Switch data files					Adam Buchsbaum


EXAMPLES:
nf "/usr/anon/cs3b"			Assigns /usr/anon/cs3b as
					the new data file.

nf p:					print the current data file

DESCRIPTION:

nf allows you to specify any file that contains data useful to comb to
be used in commands such as gt, ad, etc.  nf requires a full path
name.  The last three chars of the file name can then be changed when
giving a scan number.  They will also be automatically advanced when
crossing file boundaries in gt or ad (not true for NRAO 12-m pdfl files,
see 'gt ?!').

See gt ?! for a discussion of scan numbers in comb and the environment
variable SCANFILE which can remove the need to use nf.
