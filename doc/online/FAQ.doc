        Welcome to COMB Frequently Asked Questions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. How do you pronounce comb?
A. Comb is pronounced like the first syllable of the word "combine." It is
   most definitely not pronounced like the grooming instrument.

Q. What does comb stand for?
A. Nothing.

Q. When I type 'comb' I get the error message:

    ERROR: missing file arg (cm3)

   What does that mean?
A. It means you are really running the UNIX SCCS program which is,
   unfortunately, called 'comb.'  Change your PATH so that $COMB/bin is
   first.

Q. How can I get help about comb on my local site?
A. Try the site page (http://astro.berkeley.edy/pound/sites.html)
   which has pointers to local help files if they exist.

Q. Is there a macro to do ...?
A. Maybe. You can check out the global macros file $COMB/lib/.GMACROS with
   dm g:. Also ask around to other users.

Q. Can comb read spectra in ... format?
A. Comb can read spectra in the following formats:

  1. Bell Labs Spectral Data Format
  2. NRAO PDFL and SDD formats
  3. FITS files written by most other singledish programs (e.g. CLASS, SPA).

  There is a standalone program for converting Arecibo spectra to comb stacks.
  This program is available from Marc Pound.

Q. What does "Collecting garbage in search file" mean?
A. If you have made many changes to your current stacks directory, e.g.,
   stored or emptied many stacks, comb will update and clean out the search
   file for that directory, and give you this message. It is normal and nothing
   to worry about.

Q. When I type lk, I don't see anything or see only a portion of my stack
   locations. What's wrong?
A. There are several possibilities:

  1. You don't have a relative coordinate system defined (or you've got the
     wrong one defined). Use rc to define one.
  2. You have previously restricted the stack number range or the frequency
     range such that no stacks match the restrictions. You can un-restrict
     them with the sn: or fr: flags to lk.
  3. If and only if all the above fail to fix your problem, then it is
     possible that your search file has been corrupted. This can happen if
     multiple users have the same stacks directory open and are storing or
     emptying stacks. It can be repaired with up.

Q. How do I write FITS images or cubes so that the FITS keywords RA---SIN
   and DEC--SIN are present instead of RA and DEC?
A. Set op ortho: for orthographic projection before making the map.

Q. Why doesn't the initial value of .rms in a scan match the value that rm
   gives for that scan?
A. Because pl uses the value of .rms in autoscaling plots, an initial value
   of .rms is estimated by gt based on receiver noise, filter width,
   integration time, and switching mode. (If .rms were left as zero, pl would
   blow up when trying to plot). As soon as you have the baseline under
   control, you should run rm on the stack to calculate the true rms.

Q. After I remove a baseline with li, the stack rms value .rms has not
   changed. What gives?
A. The stack rms must be recalculated with rm.

Q. Sometimes when I contour an image with cp, I see nothing in the plot and
   the contour labels with numbers like 1E-308,...,5E-313. What gives?
A. You have given comb a contour step which is greater than the data range
   present in the image. Try cp a:, which will automatically contour the image
   and give you a better idea of the data range.

Q. Why can't comb do greyscale?
A. The short answer is "We're working on it." If you want the long answer,
   ask Bob or Marc.

Q. I got this message from comb:

      *** SOFTWARE PROBLEM ***
      Caught signal: {SIGNAL NUMBER} in command {COMMAND}.
      Do you want to make a record?

   What does it mean and what should I do?
A. This means you have either uncovered a bug in comb, or somehow got it
   into a state where it wants to dump core. You should answer 'y' to the
   question and then e-mail the file $COMB/lib/cerr to
   pound@teddi.berkeley.edu. Please indicate what you were doing at the time.
   If you have a limit on coredump (e.g., in csh), $COMB/lib/cerr may not
   contain useful information, but send it anyway. In either case, you may wish
   to quit comb and start it up again.

The FAQ will grow as I think of more questions. Suggestions are welcome!
