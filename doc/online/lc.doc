lc - list commands					Matthew Miller


EXAMPLES:
lc					list commands

DESCRIPTION:
Lc gives a list of all the commands available in comb with a single line
description of each.  If there is no on-line documentation for the command,
an asterisk is printed at the end of the description.

NOTE: 
An asterisk after the listing means there is no on-line documentation 
for that command, so '?!' won't help you. However, ' ??' is always of use.
Documentation exists for all commands in the standard release version 
of comb.  So if there is no documentation for a command, it means it is a 
non-standard command.
