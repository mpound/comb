ri - Redirect comb's command input to a file or string

EXAMPLES:

...;ri "t";...		At the 'ri' command the file t will be read for
			commands.  Redirection will end at the EOF
c $={p "Hello World"};ri str:$	Yet another way to print Hello World.  This
			will work with any header or user defined variable.

DESCRIPTION:

If a file name is given, 'ri' opens the file and reads commands from it
until reaching the EOF.  "ri' can be nested in command files until COMB
runs out of open file descriptors.  There must be carriage return after
the string of commands.

If a string is given, comb executes the string as though it had been
typed at the terminal.  The main use of the string option is to execute
strings in variables.
