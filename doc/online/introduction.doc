                        Introduction
                  --------------------------

Comb is an analysis package for single-dish radio astronomical spectral
line data reduction.  It can be installed on any computer using the
UNIX (or variant like LINUX) operating system.  In general, you want to
run comb on a tty capable of line graphics; 'xterm' is a good choice.
A new public version of comb is released each year, after sufficient
changes have accumulated at the programming sites. Intermediate
versions are available on request.

Most comb commands consist of two-character names chosen to be
suggestive of their function.  There are also a few single character
commands.  The command "lc" (list commands) gets you a summary list.
Appending the string " ?!" to any command name, will give the on-line
documentation about that command. The string " ??" appended to the
command will give the input arguments for that command. The string " ?"
appended to the command will make comb prompt you for each argument to
the command. This is known as 'hand-hold mode' and is a good way to
learn the inputs for each command.  For help on command-line syntax,
see the Help topics 'syntax' and 'special_chars'.

There are a couple of concepts you need to be familiar with to
understand how comb works: see the Help topics 'glossary' and
'variables'.

contains information about source code updates, and FAQ, and other
useful stuff.
