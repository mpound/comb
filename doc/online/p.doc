p - print a value					Matthew Miller


EXAMPLES:
p 57				print 57
p log(3|27)			print log base 3 of 27
p $3				print the value of string variable 3
p .ndat				print the current scan number
p #1=2				assign the value 2 to global numeric
				variable 1 and print it
p $5="hello" dp:		assign the value "hello" to string
				variable 5 but don't print it. 
				Same as c $5="hello".
p .numst nl:;p .dl nl:;p .db	print the stack number of the stack in stack
				1 followed by the l and b offsets.
p #=#+1 dp:			increment global numeric variable 0. 
				Same as c #=#+1.
p .rms1=.25			change the value of rms in the stack 1
				header to 0.25
p .stak2(68)			print the value of channel 68 of stack2.
p .stak1(68)= 10		set channel 68 of stack1 to 10 for a test.

DESCRIPTION:
P is used to evaluate an expression and print the result.  Often p is
used for the side effect of assigning a new value to a global or header
variable during evaluation.  In this case the dp: flag can be used to
suppress printing. 

The 'nl' flag will make p print two spaces instead of a line feed at the end.

The dp: flag suppresses the printing; this feature is superseded by the
command "c".

Note: INTEGER data types are just special cases of REALs.
