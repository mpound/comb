rm - calculate rms and ssb noise figure for stack 1	Adam Buchsbaum


EXAMPLES:
rm				Print rms and ssb noise figure for stack 1.
rm dp:				Calculate values but don't print.

DESCRIPTION:

Rm calculates the root mean square and single sideband noise figure for
all the active channels (set by "us") in stack 1 and then prints its
results.  The rms value is also put in the variable rms in stack 1 
(i.e., it can be referred to as .rms1).
