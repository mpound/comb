v - Compute value for map

in,!0,!1 dp:;v .area1	- Compute value for map of integrated intensity.
			  This is the default macro for cm, the macro
			  named "T*dV".

gf,!0,1 dp:; v .fwhm    - Compute a value for map of line width.

This command computes a value and either:

    1) If a contour map is being made puts it where the value routine
	will find it. In this case the 'v' is embedded in the macro
	passed to 'cm'.

    2) If no contour map is being made, 'v' prints the value just like 'p'.
