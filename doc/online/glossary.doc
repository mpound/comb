                         Things You Should Know
                       ---------------------------

SCAN - 	The data as they come from the telescope. Scans are read from the 
	file you attach with "nf", in which they are stored sequentially. 
	Except in special circumstances, a comb user cannot write to a 
	scan file. Scans are gotten with "gt".

STACK -	The location of a spectrum on which you can operate. Stacks come in 
	two flavors:

	   1) core- or memory-resident. These are stacks 1, 2, and 3 and
	      are stored in memory. Most comb commands operate on 
	      core resident stacks. Core-resident stacks disappear when
	      you quit comb.
	   2) disk stacks. These are stacks 4 through 262143 (the maximum
	      number of stacks allowed). 

	Disk stacks are stored in a directory opened with "ns". A stacks
	directory contains 5 files called 'data', 'default', 'index', 
	'macros', and 'search' which have the following functions:

	   data     Contains the spectral headers and channel data 
                    in binary form.  
	   default  ASCII file containing information on user preferences 
		    such as relative coordinates.  
   	   index    A table of pointers to the data location corresponding 
		    to the beginning of each stack in 'data' 
	   macros   ASCII file containing the user macros applicable to 
		    these stacks only.  
	   search   A lookup table linking stack numbers to locations in the 
		    sky  

        Stacks are retrieved with "rt".

RELATIVE COORDINATES - In order to construct a contour map, you first 
	must tell comb the coordinate system in which you wish to make it. 
	This is known as the 'relative coordinate system' and is done
	with "rc". Once you have defined your coordinate system, you can 
	also retrieve stacks by their relative coordinates ("rt rc:").

INTERPOLATION - When comb makes any map ("cm", "vc", "wc") or averages 
	spectra ("co", "is", "ad", "vm") it asks the user what type
	of smoothing/weighting it should use when combining spectra.
	The interpolation types are near-point, cone, Gaussian, and Bessel
	and their details are discussed in the cm documentation ("cm ?!").
	The smoothing for each point is applied over a user-supplied 
	interpolation radius (always given in units of arcminutes), 
	such that any spectra within a circle of that radius centered
	on the point are included in the average.

PROJECTIONS -  The default relative coordinate system in comb is 
	"observer's offsets" in arcminutes---i.e., the way you usually
	take data at the telescope. This is not a true projection. You
	can specify a particular projection (e.g. gnomonic, mercator) 
        for your maps with "op".
	
MACRO - A macro is a small program which allows you to perform 
	arbitrarily complicated operations without having to do much
	typing. See the Help topic 'macros'.

VARIABLE - Variables in comb can be strings or numbers. Certain
	special variables begin with "$" or "#". Scan/Stack header
	variables are reserve words---you can't define new variables
	with those names. See Help topic 'variables'.

DRAGON -  A special value returned if, e.g., an integration or
        Gaussian fit fails or is undefined.  DRAGON is the variable
        DR in comb, and .DR is set equal to IEEE NaN (not a number).
	It is also the value of BLANK in maps made by cm, vc, and
	wc.  DRAGON is also used to specify "holes" in user-defined
	areas (see "da ?!"). Tony Stark came up with the name "dragon"
	to indicate unknown parts of a map as in "Here There Be Dragons."
