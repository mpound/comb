pa - pause in execution

EXAMPLES:
pa w:		Pause until you type a Return
pa t:3		Pause for three seconds
pa		Repeat the last pause. If this is the 1st use of pa in this
		execution of comb it defaults to pa w:.
pa t:		Pause for the previous amount of time (default is 1 second).

DESCRIPTION:
Pa suspends execution either for a set amount of time (seconds) or until you
type a newline.  It initially defaults to waiting for a newline, but once
you have specified a time, it will default to the last pause specified.
On non-System V machines, the amount of time can be non-integral.
