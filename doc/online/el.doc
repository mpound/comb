el - eliminate a bad channel or range of bad channels in stack 1   RWW
 

EXAMPLES:

el 41		replace chan 41, if plotting chans, or the chan at 41 Km/s
		if plotting vel with the average of the two adjacent chans.

cr,2;el x(0)_x(1)	replace a range of chans defined by reading the cursor
		twice.

DESCRIPTION:

Eliminate works just as bc does, except just on the current stack 1 data.

'crel' and 'elcr' are macros to eliminate channels using the cursor.  
They reside in .GMACROS (dm g:).
