                           -- STACK HEADER FORMAT --

               Each stack is divided into blocks of 256 16-bit  words;  the
          first  of  these  contains header information as described below.
          The first 128 words of the header block  contain  128  short  in-
          tegers,  in  an array called IHDR.  The second half of the header
          block contains real numbers and other constants, and is stored in
          an array called RHD.  "Name" is a variable name to which the user
          may refer when a particular header value is  needed.   "Old  NHD"
          refers  to positions in the stack-header produced by COMB on the
          Hewlett-Packard 2100 machines previously used for BTL data reduc-
          tion.

	  The channel values are stored in the array stak(). So, 
	  "p .stak(32)" or "p .stak1(32)" prints the value of the 32nd 
	  channel of stack 1.  Stacks 2 and 3 are in stak2() and stak3(),
	  respectively.

                                       *NOTES:

          IHDR[3] -the term "frequency processed" refers to functions  per-
                  formed  by  the  GT command.  If the parent scan did not
                  have sufficient information to provide velocity and  fre-
                  quency information in the stack, dummy values are insert-
                  ed and this number is set to 0.

          IHDR[4] -"equatorial observing  display  coordinates"  refers  to
                  RHD[47] and [48].

          IHDR[54]        -if the stack was made up of more than 32  scans,
                  an  extra  block is appended to the header containing the
                  rest of the scan numbers as short integers.  If the stack
                  consists  of  more  than  288  scans,  the remaining scan
                  numbers are lost.

          RHD[6-20]       -WEIGHTS:  the weight at a particular channel  is
                  a  measure  of  expected noise.  It is the equivalent in-
                  tegration time (in seconds) assuming  an  ideal  receiver
                  (no  atmosphere or sidelobes) at SSB noise temperature of
                  1000 K.  Thus:
                                                            2
                                ( TREC + TSKY + TSPILLOVER )
                       WEIGHT = ---------------------------- * TIME
                                          1000000

                  The weights are configured such that the weight of  chan-
                  nels  1  through  IHDR[7]-1 is stored in RHD[6], that for
                  channels IHDR[7] through IHDR[8]-1 is stored  in  RHD[7],
                  etc.  up  through  the last channel. If more than 16 dis-
                  tinct weights are needed, the closest two  will  be  com-
                  bined and replaced with the average.

          RHD[47],[48]    -the values of the offsets, as displayed  on  the
                  screen  during observations with the 7-m antenna at Craw-
                  ford Hill:
                                  ODRA = DRA * COS( DEC + DDEC ) * 900
                                  ODDEC = DDEC * 60  .

          RHD[63-64]      -the  line  frequency  is  stored  as  a  double-
                  precision quantity.
