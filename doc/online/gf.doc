gf - Gauss fit

EXAMPLES:
gf 50,70		Fit a Gaussian to the data in stack 1 between channels
			50 and 70 (if horiz plot units are channels), modify
			the header variables in stack 1 and print the results.

gf,50,70,see:dp:	Fit a Gaussian as above, but replace the data in stack
			1 with the function and make an overlay plot. Don't
			print.

rs -1; gf,50,70 rm:     Fit a Gaussian to an absorption line by inverting the
			line with 'rs -1'. Remove the Gaussian after the 
			fit.


DESCRIPTION:

Gf fits a positive Gaussian function to the data in stack 1 using a gradient
search method. The fit is made only over the 'horizontal interval of fit' which
is given in plot units. The parameters of the fit are stored in the header
variables (see below). They are also printed on the terminal unless suppressed
by the 'dp' flag.

The 'action in stack 1' node controls additional action. Default is none.  
The 'see:' flag causes the data in stack 1 to be replaced by the fitted
Gaussian and plotted as an overlay. The 'rm:' flag causes the Gaussian 
function to be subtracted from stack 1 to show the residuals.

The 'wid' node allows you to specify the width of the Gaussian in plot units.

Values returned by gf are which are stored in the stack header are

  ftmax - peak temperature of fitted Gaussian
  fterr - error in ftmax
  fpeak - horizontal location of ftmax in plot units
  fperr - error in fpeak
  fwhm - fitted full width at half maximum in plot units
  fwerr - error in fwhm
  area - area of Gaussian in (K * plot units).
  chisq - reduced chi-squared of the fit
  nfree - number of free parameters (usually the number of channels - 2)

As usual, these are accessible via the "dot mechanism", e.g. 'p .fwhm'.

If the fit did not converge all the values are set to .DR. 

See Bevington for a discussion of the fitting technique.
