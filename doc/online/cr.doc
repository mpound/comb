DESCRIPTION:
cr turns the cursor of your terminal on and reads its position when you
strike a key or click a mouse button. If 'n' is given it is read n times. 
The horizontal and vertical positions of the cursor are converted to plot 
units and may be accessed in a numeric expression as an argument to a 
command. The tokens 'x(m)' and 'y(m)' have the values from the 
m'th cursor read and may be used in any expression.

The token 'crsr(m)' will have the value 1 unless the key you struck to make
the m'th reading was 'e'. For xterms, a carriage return must be
entered after the keystroke or mouse-click.
