DESCRIPTION:
Ph is used to evaluate an expression and print the result in 'hms' format.

The 'nl' flag will make ph print a space instead of a line feed at the end.

The 'gs:' option instructs ph to put its output in a global string.
The 'nv:' option instructs ph to put its output in a named (user-defined) 
string.
