gs - put STO data into stack 1     AAS & CM

EXAMPLES:

gs,23,4			Get the 4th backend from FITS file 000023.
gs 000023 be:4		Get the 4th backend from FITS file 000023.

gs &+1 be:5		Get the 5th backend from the next FITS file.

DESCRIPTION:

Gs converts STO data into stack data, and is a way of reading STO data
into COMB.  Before calling the gs command, it is necessary to identify
the STO FITS file to COMB using the nf command.   The nf command is given
a string that holds the absolute address (starting at root "/") of the 
FITS file up to the first 6 characters of the FITS file name (e.g.
> nf "/usr/home/aas/stodata/STO11a").  The gs command would generally
be used in a loop, using the auto increment feature to transfer a series
of STO FITS files to a COMB stack directory, e.g.:
nf "/usr/home/aas/stodata/STO11a"; gs,0; st 11; do,1000 {gs,&+1; st a:}

The backend can be specified either by number or name. The backend starts out
set to 1 and remembers its current type until changed.

The gs command makes no attempt to calibrate or reference-subtract the data.
Use the stack division capability of the ca command to do an S-R/R 
calculation.
