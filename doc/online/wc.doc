wc - write out a FITS cube from stacks data                       RWW

Examples:

wc 10,-10,-10,10 np:[21,21] ir:1 ci: vl:-8,4 ff:"mydata.fits"
					write a FITS cube called "mydata.fits"
					from the current foreground stacks
					with given x and y limits and 21 spatial
					points on each spatial axis (naxis1, 
             				naxis2).  Velocity limits are given 
					as -8 to 4 km/s.

wc (write cube) is sort of like a combination of cm and vc in its 
input options.  The data are written out on a regular grid after
interpolation (if any) of spectra at each point. wc doesn't plot anything, 
but after writing the cube in the file, you may do contour plots with cp.
To that end, cp has a pl: option (plane) which allows you to plot
any space-space plane from the cube.

This version of wc uses the same basic routine as vc.  It picks the end
velocities so that the velocities of the planes correspond to channels
in the example spectrum.  In case of spectra which are shifted, the
closest channel is used.

The macros 'vlct' and 'chan' in .GMACROS is useful for finding out 
the velocity of any channel or vice versa, e.g.
 
-> vlct,1           ! print the velocity of channel 1
-73.899149
 
-> chan,-73.9       ! print the channel number of the given velocity
0.998691
 
You don't have to get the velocity exactly right, since wc uses
the channel nearest the specified velocity.

As with cm, the best way to learn this command, is to use handhold
mode by typing 'wc ?' . See also 'cm ?!' and 'vc ?!'
