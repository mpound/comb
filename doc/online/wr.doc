wr - write a scan back into the file


EXAMPLE:
wr		write the last scan read back into the file as the scan
		number given by .ScanNum.  Any changes to header
	        variables will be written.

gt 5; c .Telescop="AST/RO";wr 
		change the Telescop header variable in scan 5 and write
		it back on the data file.

DESCRIPTION:
wr is used for editing scan data. It is not for general use as it has the
potential to destroy the data file.  In the distributed source
code of comb, wr is disabled. If you really think you need wr,
consult a comb programmer for instructions how to enable it.
