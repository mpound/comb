rt - Retrieve a stack into stack 1			Matthew Miller


EXAMPLES:
rt 2			retrieve stack 2 from core
rt 5_10			retrieve stacks 5 through 10 from the current
			foreground directory and display them one
			by one
rt 6 "sName" dt:	Set up sName as the background directory and then
			retrieve stack 6 from it.
rt 6 u:			retrieve stack 6 from the current foreground
			directory and  toggle the stack use flag.  If the stack
			use flag is set, set the use array to the value
			it was when stack 6 was stored
p #=9;do w:"(#=#+1)<=85" {rt # t:;do i:".test" {st a:dt:}}
			Store all stacks between 10 and 85 with data in them
			in directory two.
rt rc:-2,4 dest:2	Retrieve a stack at (-2,4) in the current relative
			coordinate system and put it in stack 2.
rt rc:-2,4 sn:20,155	Retrieve a stack at (-2,4) after setting the range of
			stack numbers to be searched to [20,155].

DESCRIPTION:
Rt copies stack 'n' into stack 1.  Stacks 1-3 are core resident.
Higher numbered stacks will be retrieved from a stacks directory.

If the Directory name is not given, the current foreground/background
directory will be used depending on whether the dt: flag is given (dt: ->
background).

If the 'u' flag is set, then the use array is set to the value it was
when the stack was stored.  If it is not set, then the use array is set
to the last saved value (see us).

The dest: option allows you to retrieve to any core resident stack.

Normally rt gives an error message and stops if the requested stack is
empty.  If the t: flag is given the 'header' variable .test is set to 1 if
the stack is full and to 0 otherwise and no error stop is taken.

You can retrieve by position by using the rc: option.  A valid relative
coordinate system must be defined first.  The positions given should be
longitude then latitude type coordinates.  The first stack found
within the current position tolerance (ptol in ' arc) will be
retrieved, but others found in this range will be listed by number on the
terminal.  A range of frequencies or stack numbers may be given if you
wish to exclude some of the stacks in the file.  These ranges will be
remembered until changed or you quit comb.
