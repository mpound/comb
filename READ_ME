==============================================================================

*************************************************************************
** TO INSTALL COMB, YOU MUST HAVE AN ANSI C COMPILER (gcc will work).  **
*************************************************************************

The installation steps are as follows:

	0) If you are root, you may want to use the -o option to 
	   tar ( --same-owner for GNU tar) when de-archiving the comb tar
           file. This prevents owner conflicts in some O/S's.

	1) Set the environment variable COMB to the the full name of 
           the directory that contains "bin" "doc" and "obj"
	   (i.e., the one where you find this note).  Your path must include
	   $COMB/bin.

        2) Run the setup script appropriate to your OS and compiler. These
	   scripts set the correct values in $COMB/src/machinedep.h and 
	   set flags for various compilers.

            For SunOS 4.x.y (= Solaris 1.x.y) with acc:
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.sunos

            For SunOS 4.x.y (= Solaris 1.x.y) with gcc:
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.sunos.gcc

	    For Solaris 2.x.y with the SUNWspro C compiler:
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.sol

	    For Solaris 2.x.y with the GNU C compiler (gcc):
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.sol.gcc

	    For HP computers:
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.hp

	    For LINUX operating systems:
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.linux

	    For all other computers:
	       cd $COMB/lib; setup.other

        3) [Non-Sun Microsystem computers only, excluding HP 700. ] 
           Make any additional changes in $COMB/src/main/machinedep.h (see 
	   comments in that file) to tailor it to your machine.  For instance, 
	   if you are compiling on a DEC, PC, or other "LittleEndian" byte order
	   machine, change the line in machinedep.h 
		#define BYTEREVERSED 0
	   to
		#define BYTEREVERSED 1
	   
	   For HP 300 and 400 computers, machinedep.h should have the HP_700 
	   bit turned off: 
		#define HP_700   0 

	4) This step describes how to set up printers for comb in the "standard"
	   way. If you are adept enough to have your own special customizations
           to the comb printer files, read (and execute if necessary) this 
           step and then consult PRINTER CUSTOMIZATIONS below. 

	   Comb supports the following printer types: PostScript, Imagen, 
           HP LaserJet III, HP-GL, and Tektronix.  If you wish to use a printer
           that is not one of these types, see the UNSUPPORTED PRINTERS below.

           To get hardcopies from comb, you must set up the associated printer
           files, $COMB/src/cmd/hc/hc.t and $COMB/lib/hc.lpr. 
	   Not to worry, though, as these files will be automatically 
           set up for you when you do the following:

	         cd $COMB/lib
		 make
                 hcsetup
	   
	   hcsetup will prompt you for printer names, etc.  For System V
           Unix operating systems, the default print command (generated
           by hcsetup) is 

              lp -o nobanner -d ${PRINTER} -c ${FILE}; rm ${FILE}

	   For HP systems, the default print command is

              lp -o nb -oraw -d ${PRINTER} -c ${FILE}; rm ${FILE}

	   For non-System V operating systems it is

	      lpr -P${PRINTER} -h -r -s ${FILE}
	
	   If you wish to change the default print command ("lp ..."), 
           you can simply edit this line in hc.lpr. If you change the 
           default print command after running "makecomb" (step 5), 
           you do NOT have to recompile comb, since hc.lpr is a shell script. 

           However, if, after running "makecomb install" (Step 5), you wish to 
           add or delete a printer (or otherwise change the "PRINTER=" line in 
           hc.lpr), it is easiest to do this with hcsetup so that hc.lpr and 
           the "hc ??" command will match up. Then the hardcopy command
   	   must be recompiled and via:
	   
		cd $COMB/bin
		remake_printers
		
	5) To compile the whole thing, run "makecomb install" (in $COMB/bin).
	   This visits each directory and runs 'make' there.  If no sources 
           have been changed and the .o files are still there, nothing 
	   will be recompiled.  To force a complete recompilation, run 
 	   "cleancomb" first.
	
	6) In order to take advantage of comb's history mechanism 
	   (and to usefully edit macros), you must have the environment 
	   variable EDITOR set. E.g., for csh,

		setenv EDITOR /usr/ucb/vi
	   or
		setenv EDITOR /usr/local/bin/emacs

 	   Each user should put her editor preference in her .login, .profile,
           or .cshrc file.

	7) [Little Endian (BYTEREVERSED=1) machines only]
           To swap the bytes on the sample stacks directory in $COMB/lib, 
           which was written on a Sun, start up comb and type 

		up ".../lib/sampleSTACKS" swap: 

	   (substitute the definition of $COMB for ...). 

	   YOU MUST ALSO DO THIS FOR ANY OTHER STACKS DATA YOU MAY HAVE THAT 
	   CAME FROM A BIG ENDIAN MACHINE.  It only needs to be done once.
           
	   If you have any "old-style" Bell Labs raw data files (pre-1991),
	   they should be byte-swapped with 'dd conv=swab.' BLSDF ("new" Bell
	   Labs). Currently, NRAO SDD and PDFL raw data files cannot be read on
	   a Little Endian machine.

        8) [optional] 
	   In comb, type 'diag' to run a diagnostics macro. 
	   This attempts to run some of the more commonly used comb 
           commands. Unsuccessful completion of 'diag' means 
	   something is wrong. The converse is not necessarily true.

	9) [optional]
           If your site has several users, it is useful to set up a script 
           called 'comb' on /local/bin or other public place, which contains 
           something like:

		#! /bin/csh
		if( `/usr/bin/arch` == "sun3" ) then
			setenv COMB /local/pkg/comb.sun3
		else
			setenv COMB /local/pkg/comb
		endif
		set path = ( $COMB/bin $path)
		exec comb

	   This way, each user does not have to have COMB defined. Note this
	   particular example allows for both sun4 and and sun3 users.

       10) On some systems, there may be an SCCS command called "comb", which 
           can cause confusion. You can either rename $COMB/bin/comb or just 
           make sure that $COMB/bin is before the SCCS directory in the path. 
           Note that the example above does this.  On HP machines, the binary 
           is automatically renamed to Comb in both "makecomb install" and 
	   "remake_printers".

       11) Upon successful installation of comb, please register as a comb 
	   site using the Comb Page on the World Wide Web:

           http://www.astro.umd.edu/~mpound/comb.html

	   For those without a connection to the World Wide Web, contact 
           Bob Wilson or Marc Pound and tell him you have successfully
	   installed comb (include the version number).

		Bob:  (617) 496-7744 
		      Center For Astrophysics

	  We are also happy to help if you have installation trouble.
	  This last step is important: if we don't know you have comb,
	  you won't get updates. 

======================================================================
OTHER UTILITIES INCLUDED IN THIS DISTRIBUTION:

Three routines for manipulating FITS headers are automatically installed
when you run "makecomb install." In combination, these programs
can be used to edit headers of FITS images.

1) $COMB/bin/listhd: list contents of FITS header at 80 chars per line
       		     until the END card is encountered.

        Usage: listhd FITSFILE or [command that outputs FITSFILE] | listhd
 
2) $COMB/bin/gethd: extract a FITS header into an ASCII file 80 chars per line.
 
        Usage: gethd FITSFILE or [command that outputs FITSFILE] | gethd
 
        writes file FITSFILE.hdr
 
3) $COMB/bin/puthd: given an ASCII FITS header and FITS image, replace with
                    header on the image with the given header.
 
        Usage: puthd FITSFILE
 
        expects file FITSFILE.hdr to exist; writes new file FITSFILE.new

======================================================================
PRINTER CUSTOMIZATIONS:

If you want to change printer files (e.g., add or delete a printer)
but don't want your customizations to hc.lpr overwritten by hcsetup, you can
edit $COMB/src/cmd/hc/hc.t by hand. Hc.t is the file that you see
when you type 'hc ??'  and is essentially a list of printer names followed
by the letter you chose to have comb recognize each printer by or "unused"
if it is an unused slot.  For instance:

		"Sun" "s":;		
                "PostScript 2" "unused":;

and "hc s:" would cause comb to print the current picture using "lp -dsun ...".
The 2nd PostScript slot is unused.  To add a printer you must change
appropriate the name and letter in hc.t, e.g.  

		"Sun" "s":;		
                "NewPrinter" "n":;

You also need to change the corresponding "PRINTER=" line in hc.lpr, e.g.
from
        	post2)
                	PRINTER=unused

to
        	post2)
                	PRINTER=newprinter

The value of PRINTER *must* correspond *exactly* to the printer name to be 
sent to the lp command.

To delete a printer, simply reverse the above (i.e., change from newprinter
to unused, etc.)

After this, hc.t and hc.c must be recompiled. You can do this with
$COMB/bin/remake_printers.  **This script will also rename the resulting
binary from cmbt to [cC]omb.**

======================================================================
UNSUPPORTED PRINTERS:
 
If you have `xwd' (X window dump) and 'xpr' (print an X window dump)
available on your system, you can use the following trick (thanks
to Tom Kuiper). Edit hc.lpr so that one of the unused printer slots has
the following (this example uses the second LaserJet slot 'lj2' and
a printer named 'reber'):
 
            lj2)
                echo You have 3 seconds to make sure the Tek window is on top
                sleep 3
                xwd -name "tektronix(Tek)" | \
                xpr -device ljet -cutoff 100 -portrait | \
                lp -oraw -dreber
                exit 0
                ;;
	
The printer slot "LaserJet 2" in hc.t must be set to an appropriate
identifying name/letter (see PRINTER CUSTOMIZATIONS above), followed by
"remake_printers."

======================================================================
Special instructions for installation at NRAO 12-m, Kitt Peak:

    There is one routine, wu (what's up) that defaults to
    the latitude of the Bell Labs telescope.  I have another
    version that defaults to the 12-m telescope latitude.

	cd $COMB/src/cmd/wu
	mv wu.t.kp wu.t
	
    Do this before you run 'makecomb.' Then continue with step 5 in 
    the main installation procedure above.

    Any questions, contact Marc Pound.

======================================================================
Modifying existing comb code (NOT GENERALLY RECOMMENDED):

In order to change any part of comb, you modify the appropriate code in
$COMB/src, then run "make" on it while still in its directory.  This
will move the object code into $COMB/obj, using the shell script
LN_TO_OBJ (in $COMB/bin).  The object code should be loaded using
"ldcmb", which is found in $COMB/bin.  This produces an executable file
named "cmbt", which is your new version of "comb".  When you are
satisfied with the new version, 'cd $COMB/bin' and 'mvcmb'

Note that many ".h" files are included elsewhere in the comb source.
It is usually safest to run "makecomb" (with no arguments) 
after changing a ".h" file, then "ldcmb".
======================================================================

Running comb under Windows NT

RWW 07/1999:

I have run comb on NT, but it it not ready for distribution.  In fact I
have lost much of my original enthusiasm for NT.  I could make a binary
distribution of comb, but I don't have a workable replacement for xterm
on NT.  I succeded in having comb with graphics by running the telnet
server which comes with UWIN, running TeraTerm (which does behave like
xterm) and telnetting back in to the same computer to run comb.
