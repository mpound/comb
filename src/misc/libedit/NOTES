I got libedit to run by making two changes:

In history.c I changed the compiled in value of hist_fname[] from ./history
to /.history.  It was trying to open $HOME./history.

In io.h I changed the definition of fnobuff from:
#define fnobuff(fp)	((fp)->flag&IONBF)	/* file is unbuffered */
to:
#define fnobuff(fp)	((fp) != 0 && (fp)->flag&IONBF)	/* file is unbuffered */
The original was causing a segmentation error if the file wasn't open yet.

I haven't had to make either of the changes above to get libedit.a to work.
I have made changes marked by 'RWW' in :

	editlib.c:/*RWW*/
	history.c:    /*RWW mod in response to Shudong Zhou's problem.
	edit.h:/*RWW*/
	sh_config.h:/* RWW define for programs like comb that prefer to call a special read
