Tom,

I will set off my replies with a '|'.  I will enter units in the comments
of the original file.  Frequencies are in MHz.  L, b, az, el, and dec
are in degrees.  Ra is in hours.


Bob

Hello Bob:

Phil and I have been looking at how to create a data file that is comb
compatible. Since we haven't yet defined the header and data for the
balloon project, we've decided to use data obtained at Tidbinbilla to
see what kinds of problems we encounter. The following is a sample
descriptor prepared by Phil, as well as some questions he has. I'll
annotate (see the >'s) his message to clarify it (I hope).

Regarding your question of last week on what you should bring with
you, I guess we'll be concentrating on this compatibility question.
I don't know what, if anything, you need that isn't already here.
In a pinch, there's always ftp.

Will you be staying with me the whole time, or just Fri + Sat? When
will you arrive?

Regards

        Tom

Questions regarding COMB's handling of header variables.

1.  If a header variable is not recognized by COMB, does COMB ignore 
    it, assign it incorrectly or just halt execution.

        > I believe that comb ignores it.

	| True.  I realize that Comb should be able to list those values,
	| though.

2.  We have added some variables which may refer to some quantity 
    derivable from other existing header variables.  Who translates,
    COMB or us?  This may be a continuation of the first question.

        > All the new header variables are identified with a *** in
        > the comment line. It seems clear to me now that it is asking
        > a lot of comb to be able to handle ANY data file, just because

	| Yes, I agree.  I am willing to take your date format, because I
	| realize that mine is off the wall.

>3.     The descriptor doesn't say anything about units (e.g. MHz, GHz, etc.)
>       We've put them in some of our descriptions.

| I will add units to my original header also.
