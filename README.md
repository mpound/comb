# comb
Archive of source code for *comb*, the AT&amp;T Bell labs singledish radio astronomy spectral line data reduction and analysis package. By the way, it is pronounced like the first syllable of "combine" (from whence the name derives - combining spectra), **not** like the hair styling implement!

Comb was actively developed and maintained from the mid 1980s to ~2000 by Robert W. Wilson, Marc W. Pound, Antony A. Stark, and others.  Pound developed a distribution system with install script that significantly increased the uptake of the code.  It's most recent incarnation was for use with the Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory, which moved it into a (now-defunct) CVS repository and made a few changes.  A cookbook was written in 1990, available in the *doc* subdirectory.
