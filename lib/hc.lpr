# Called from comb printer drivers in /local/pkg/comb/graphics 
# laser.driver.c, im.driver.c, lj.driver.c, etc.
#
# This holds up to 4 PostScript, 2 Imagen,  2 LaserJet, 
# 1 HP-GL, and 1 Tektronix printers.
#
# Substitute your printer name(s) for astro2, bima2,  unused, etc.
# If you don't have this many printers, just change as many as you
# have. Change the others to 'unused' to indicate that they aren't used.
# Edit the default print command at the end of this file to match your
# system.
